    <div><h1>What is Python?</h1><br>
        Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>
        
      <h1>  It is used for:</h1><br>
        
        web development (server-side),<br>
        software development,<br>
        mathematics,<br>
        system scripting.<br>
        <h1>What can Python do?</h1><br>
        Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
        Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
        Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
        Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
        Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>
       <h1> Why Python?</h1><br>
        Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br>
        Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br>
        Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br>
        Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br>
        Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.<br>
